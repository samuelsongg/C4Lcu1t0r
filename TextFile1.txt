19. As a system quality engineer,
	
	I want to customize the command-line calculator to perform system quality metrics, including defect density calculations, shipped source instructions (SSI) updates, and Musa Logarithmic model calculations
	
	so that I can calculate failure intensity and expected failures.

User Story 1: Failure Intensity Using Mlusa Logarithmic MOdel
As a system quality engineer, i want to calculate the failure intensity using the Musa logarithmic model so that i can predict failure rates over time.

User Story 2: Expected Failures Calculation
As a system quality engineer, I want to calculate the expected number of failures using the Musa logarithmic model so that i can forecast system reliability.
